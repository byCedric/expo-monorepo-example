## ‚ö° Why is it fast?

This repository uses both [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to speed things up, _by a lot_. With pnpm, we leverage the installation performance using the global store cache. Turborepo helps us to run certain tasks, and cache the result if we rerun tasks with the same input or code. In the workflows we cache the [pnpm store](./.github/actions/setup-monorepo/action.yml#L37) and [Turborepo cache](./.github/actions/setup-monorepo/action.yml#L50-L56) using GitHub Actions built-in cache, resulting in the best performance possible.

### What about Metro?

In **apps/example** we leverage the Metro cache to speed up building and publishing. We use Turborepo to restore or invalidate this cache. To populate this Metro cache, the **apps/example** has a [`$ pnpm build`](./apps/example/package.json#L9) script that exports React Native bundles. The resulting Metro cache is then reused when [publishing previews](./.github/workflows/preview.yml#L26-L27) or [deploying the app](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) with [EAS Hosting](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/introduction/).

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Should I use it?

This repository demonstrates a working stack using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) in a fast monorepo, while sharing most of the codebase with web. The primary goal of this repository is to showcase what is possible with Expo while keeping the code as "vanilla" as possible. Feel free to use this repository however you prefer, but when starting a project from scratch, consider a template with more assumptions. Those assumptions should help you develop your project faster than this repository can.

## üöÄ How to use it

You can use and modify this repository however you want. If you want to use EAS to build your app, you'll need to create an [Expo access token](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings/access-tokens) and set it as `EXPO_TOKEN` GitHub actions secret.

To run the repository locally, run these two commands:

- `$ pnpm install` - This installs all required Node libraries using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
- `$ pnpm dev` - Starts the development servers for all **apps**.

### Commands

Because this monorepo uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), you don't need to run additional commands to set things up. Whenever you run `$ pnpm build`, it will build all **packages** if they aren't built yet. In this monorepo we use a few commands or pipelines:

- `$ pnpm dev` - Build and watch all **apps** and **packages** for development.
- `$ pnpm lint` - Analyze the source code of all **apps** and **packages** using ESLint.
- `$ pnpm test` - Run all tests for packages with Jest tests.
- `$ pnpm build` - Build all **apps** and **packages** for production or to publish them on npm.

When developing or deploying a single app, you might not need the development server for all apps. For example, if you need to make a fix in the example app, you don't need the dev server for all other apps. Or when deploying a single app to production, you only need to build that single app with all dependencies only used in this app.

This monorepo uses a simple npm script convention of `dev:<app-name>` and `build:<app-name>` to keep this process simple. Under the hood, it uses [Turborepo's workspace filtering](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/filtering), defined as an npm script in the root [**package.json**](./package.json).

- `$ pnpm dev:example` - Build and watch **app/example** and all **packages** used in example, for development.
- `$ pnpm build:example` - Build **apps/example** and all **packages** used in example, for production deployments

### Switching to bun, yarn or npm

You can use any package manager with Expo. If you want to use bun, yarn, or pnpm, instead of pnpm, all you have to do is:

- Remove **.npmrc**, **pnpm-lock.yaml**, and **pnpm-workspace.yaml**.
- Remove the `pnpm` property from the root **package.json** file.
- Add the [`workspaces`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) property to the root **package.json** file.
- Update the workflows to use bun, yarn, or npm instead.

> [!WARNING]
> Unfortunately, npm does not support the [workspace protocol](https://yarnpkg.com/protocol/workspace). You also have to change the `"<package>": "workspace:*"` references to just `"<package>": "*"` for npm.

## üìÅ Structure

- [`apps`](./apps) - Apps that only use packages and aren't aware of other apps.
- [`packages`](./packages) - Packages that may use external and/or other monorepo packages.

### Apps

- [`apps/example`](./apps/example) - Expo app using `lang`, `eslint-config` and `feature-home` packages.

### Packages

- [`packages/eslint-config`](./packages/eslint-config) - Preconfigured ESLint configuration for each app or package.
- [`packages/feature-home`](./packages/feature-home) - Shared React Native domain-logic for apps, using `lang`, `ui` and `eslint-config` packages.
- [`packages/ui`](./packages/ui) - Shared React Native UI components for apps, using the `eslint-config` package.
- [`packages/lang`](./packages/lang) - Localization system for apps, using the `i18n-js` and `expo-localization` package.

## üë∑ Workflows

- [`build`](./.github/workflows/build.yml) - Starts the EAS builds for **apps/example** using the given profile.
- [`deploy`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) - Deploys apps to a preview URL or production URL using [EAS Hosting](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/introduction/).
- [`preview`](./.github/workflows/preview.yml) - Publishes apps to a PR-specific release channel and adds a QR code to that PR.
- [`test`](./.github/workflows/test.yml) - Ensures that the apps and packages are healthy on multiple OSs.

### Composite workflows

- [`setup-monorepo`](./.github/actions/setup-monorepo/action.yml) - Reusable composite workflow to setup the monorepo in GitHub Actions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

### Installing multiple React Native versions

React Native is a complex library, split over multiple different packages. Unfortunately, React Native only supports a single version per monorepo. When using multiple different versions, things might break in unexpected ways without proper error reporting.

You can check if your monorepo is installing multiple versions of React Native with the `npm list` command, supported by all major package managers:

```bash
$ npm why react-native
$ yarn why react-native

# Bun doesn't have `bun why` (yet), but you can use `yarn why` instead
$ bun install --yarn && yarn why react-native

# pnpm needs `--recursive` to search in all workspaces within the monorepo
$ pnpm why --recursive react-native
```

If you are using multiple versions, try to update all **package.json** files, or use an [`overrides`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)/[`resolutions`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) in the root **package.json** to force only one React Native version.

### Using environment variables in React Native

Reusing Metro caches can be dangerous if you use Babel plugins like [transform-inline-environment-variables](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables/). When using Babel plugins to swap out environment variables for their actual value, you are creating a dependency on environment variables. Because Metro is unaware of dependencies on environment variables, Metro might reuse an incorrect cached environment variable.

Since Turborepo handles the cache in this repository, you could leverage [caching based on environment variables](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching#altering-caching-based-on-environment-variables). This invalidates the Metro cache whenever certain environment variables are changed and avoid reusing incorrect cached code.

> [!TIP]
> In this repository we rely on [Expo's built-in environment variables support](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/environment-variables/) to avoid Babel caching related issues with Metro.

### pnpm workarounds

In the current React Native ecosystem, there are a lot of implicit dependencies. These can be from the native code that is shipped within packages, or even implicit dependencies through installing a specific version of Expo or React Native. In the newer package managers like pnpm, you will run into issues due to these implicit dependencies.

To workaround these issues, we changed the following:

1. Let pnpm generate a flat **node_modules** folder, without fully isolating all modules. You can do that by creating a root [**.npmrc**](./.npmrc) file containing ([`node-linker=hoisted`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#node-linker)). This works around the issue where Expo and React Native doesn't always have correct dependency chains towards consumed libraries. Expo is actively working on removing the last few remaining issues to fully enable isolated modules, see the [internal dependency validation check](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/tools/src/check-packages/checkDependenciesAsync.ts#L28).

2. Customize the **metro.config.js** configuration for usage in this monorepo. Full explanation per configuration option can be found in the [**metro.config.js**](./apps/example/metro.config.js) itself. The only addition in this repository is the [`config.cacheStores`](./apps/example/metro.config.js#L22-L25). This change moves the Metro cache to a place which is accessible by Turborepo, our main cache handler (see [Why is it fast?](#-why-is-it-fast)).

### Precompile packages

EAS only sends the files which are committed to the repository. That means [the `packages/*/build` folders](.gitignore#L3) need to be generated before building our apps. To tell EAS how to compile our packages, we can [use the `postinstall` hook](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/build-with-monorepos/).

### Running EAS from apps directories

As of writing, the `eas build` or `eas deploy` commands need to be executed from the package folder itself. EAS will still create a tarball with all files from your monorepo, but runs the build commands from this local folder. You can see this happening in the [build workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yml#L32).

### Using local credentials in CI

If you want to maintain the keystore or certificates yourself, you have to [configure EAS with local credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/local-credentials/#credentialsjson). When your CI provider doesn't allow you to add "secret files", you can [encode these files to base64 strings](https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/local-credentials/#using-local-credentials-on-builds-triggered-from) and decode whenever you need it.

> It's highly recommended to keep keystores and certificates out of your repository to avoid security issues.
